🏎️ 3D Racing Game: An Advanced OpenGL Project
Welcome to the repository for our advanced 3D Racing Game, a high-octane driving simulation built from the ground up using OpenGL. This project pushes the boundaries of classic arcade racing with a rich set of dynamic features, creating an immersive and challenging experience. Get ready to burn rubber!

✨ Core Features
gameplay Mechanics
🚗 Responsive Car Control: Experience realistic vehicle physics with intuitive controls for acceleration, braking, and sharp turns.

Master the art of driving to navigate tight corners and overtake opponents with precision.

💥 Collision Detection System: Feel the impact with robust collision detection against track boundaries, obstacles, and other vehicles.

Drive carefully—every collision counts and can affect your performance and position in the race.

🏁 Lap & Scoring System: Compete to complete laps and climb the leaderboard with a fully functional lap counter and scoring system.

Each completed lap is tracked, with your progress and position displayed in real-time.

🔄 Instant Car Reset: Never get stuck again! A dedicated reset button instantly places your car back on the track, facing the right direction.

If you spin out or get caught on an obstacle, a quick key press gets you back in the action without losing momentum.

🚀 Nitro Boost Feature: Activate a powerful nitro boost for a temporary burst of extreme speed, perfect for overtaking rivals on a straightaway.

Use your boost strategically to gain a critical advantage, but be warned—it's a limited resource!

👻 Cheat Mode: Bend the rules of physics! Activate cheat mode to bypass collisions, allowing you to drive through obstacles and opponents unharmed.

Ideal for testing, or just for fun, this mode lets you explore the track without limits.

Track, Opponents & World Interaction
🛣️ Dynamic 3D Race Track: Race on a complex, beautifully designed 3D track featuring challenging slopes, ramps, bridges, and tunnels.

The track is more than just a flat road; its verticality and varied elements will test your driving skills at every turn.

🚧 Moving Obstacles & Hazards: Dodge a variety of dynamic obstacles like cones and barriers, and navigate treacherous track hazards like oil spills and slippery ice patches.

The environment is alive and actively works against you, demanding constant focus and quick reflexes.

😠 Aggressive Opponent AI: Compete against AI-controlled opponent cars that follow fixed racing lines and even drive towards you for head-on encounters.

These aren't passive drivers. Opponents provide a constant challenge and will fight you for the top spot.

💰 Coin-Based Reward System: Collect coins scattered throughout the track to build your score and unlock potential rewards or upgrades.

Risk and reward go hand-in-hand as you swerve off the ideal racing line to grab valuable coins.

🚶 Pedestrian Hazard: Watch out for civilians! A pedestrian will randomly attempt to cross the road, creating a sudden and unpredictable obstacle.

This dynamic event adds a layer of urban chaos and tests your reaction time.

🚓 Police Chase System: If you hit the pedestrian, you're a wanted driver! A police car will appear and begin chasing you, adding immense pressure to the race.

Evade the law while trying to win the race in this high-stakes gameplay twist.

Environment & UI
🎥 Multiple Camera Views (Mandatory Feature): Switch between several camera perspectives, including first-person, third-person (chase cam), and cinematic views.

Choose the view that best suits your playstyle or switch on the fly to get a better look at the action around you.

📊 Sleek User Interface: Stay informed with a clean and modern UI displaying a real-time lap counter, timer, race position, and a detailed speedometer.

All the critical information you need is presented clearly on-screen, allowing you to focus on the race.

🗺️ Live Minimap: Keep an eye on the bigger picture with a top-right minimap that shows an overview of the track, your position (blue), and the location of your opponents (red).

Use the minimap to anticipate turns and strategize your next move against your rivals.

🌇 Living 3D Environment: Race in a rich world filled with detailed environmental objects like buildings, trees, and a stunning skybox.

The immersive scenery creates a believable and engaging world to race in.

🏆 Game End Conditions: Cross the finish line to trigger dynamic win/lose screens, celebrating your victory or marking your defeat.

The game provides clear feedback on your performance, concluding the race with a satisfying end sequence.

☀️ Dynamic Lighting & Weather: Experience a fully dynamic world with car headlights, real-time shadows, and a weather system featuring rain, fog, and snow with particle effects.

The changing conditions not only look incredible but also affect car handling, adding another layer of challenge.

💔 Car Damage System: Your car's performance degrades as you take damage from collisions. Find repair kits to restore your vehicle or shields to protect it.

This system adds a strategic layer of survival to the race, forcing you to balance speed with safety.
